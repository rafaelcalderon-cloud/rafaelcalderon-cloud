### Hi there! I'm **Rafael Calderón** 👋  
### Cloud & DevOps Engineer in Training | Future SRE  

I’m a motivated and disciplined engineer-in-progress on the path to becoming a **Cloud, DevOps, and SRE professional**, specializing in AWS, infrastructure automation, CI/CD, and container orchestration.

My goal is to work remotely for global companies and become highly skilled in:

- **Cloud Computing** (AWS / GCP / Azure)  
- **DevOps practices** (CI/CD, automation, monitoring, IaC)  
- **Containers & Orchestration** (Docker, Kubernetes)  
- **SRE Foundations** (reliability, scalability, observability)

I’m currently building a strong portfolio through hands-on labs, personal projects, and certifications.
